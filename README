This project is going to serve as the collection of information (code, and any other resources) for a home automation project.

Like all my other projects I will probably drop it, or forget about it, or just change it into something else entirely. Regardless here it is.

The main vision of this project is to be able to issue voice commands to automate tasks around daily life.


Quick Ideas:
	Voice commands using Amazon Echo API
	Endpoint modules that use 802.11 (b,g,n,ac??)
		platforms:
			raspberry pi??
			android app??
		types:
			light switches
			garage door
			tv remotes
	Centralized server (linux daemon)
	
	
	
	
	
History:
	My original home automation efforts focused primarily on developing from scratch a module that could fit into wall sockets. The basis of the hardware would be a AVR microcontroller, and zigbee module. This effort failed mostly do to the fact that I did not have a good way of interfacing digital components with standard light switches. I also was not comfortable putting PoC electronics in my wall powered off the 120 volt AC without fear of burning down my house.
